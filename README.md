# Media server docker containers
This will setup sonarr, sabnzbd, couchpotato, deluge and headphones as docker
containers.

## Data and Storage directories:
You will need to modify the docker-compose.yml file to point to your data and
storage dirs.
These are the directories on your host server that you want to expose to the
docker containers.

This will give you a way to save state outside of the containers themselves, so
that config and db files will persist. You can also setup a cronjob to backup
these folders to the cloud incase of a drive failure.

* /mnt/storage/dockerdata=(where the config files and db files will be kept)
* /media/nas=(where all processed downloads will be saved)
* /mnt/storage/tmp=(where incomplete downloads will be saved)
* /mnt/storage/downloads=(where unprocessed downloads will be saved)

> Sickbeard is included but not used, I use sonarr instead but if you want to
  use sickbeard just modify the docker-compose.yml to build that image instead.

To build and run:

`sudo docker-compose up -D`
